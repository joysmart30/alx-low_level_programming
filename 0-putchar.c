/**
 * main - Print _putchar
 * Return: Always 0
 * Originally, the header file i used in main.h was
 * int _putchar (char *)
 * this is because i wanted my output to be
 * a string of _putchar and i wont type so much
 * and so my original description was
 *
 * char *x;
 *
 * x = "_putchar";
 * printf("%s\n", x);
 *
 * and it worked
 * but on getting to Task 1, i realised
 * i still need to use the function _putchar and
 * it can only print out a char
 * so my code had to be modified to this...
